# Java Basics – Core Foundations 🚀

This repository contains my **Java basics practice programs**, written while building a strong foundation in programming logic.
The focus is on **clear understanding**, **clean code**, and **incremental learning** using simple problems.

These programs cover essential concepts that are required before moving into **DSA, backend development, and interviews**.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

* Variables and Data Types
* Input and Output using `Scanner`
* Conditional Statements (`if–else`)
* Loops (`for`, basic iteration patterns)
* Accumulator and Counter Patterns
* Basic Mathematical Logic

---

## 📂 Programs Included

### 1️⃣ Print Variables

* Demonstrates variable declaration (`int`, `double`)
* Shows output printing using `System.out.println`
* Introduces string concatenation

**Concepts:** variables, data types, output

---

### 2️⃣ Sum of Two Numbers

* Takes two integers as input
* Calculates and prints their sum

**Concepts:** input handling, arithmetic operations

---

### 3️⃣ Positive / Negative / Zero

* Determines whether a number is positive, negative, or zero

**Concepts:** conditional statements (`if–else`)

---

### 4️⃣ Print Numbers from 1 to N

* Prints numbers from `1` to a given number `N`

**Concepts:** `for` loop, iteration

---

### 5️⃣ Reverse Counting (N to 1)

* Prints numbers from `N` down to `1`

**Concepts:** reverse loops, decrementing loops

---

### 6️⃣ Sum from 1 to N

* Calculates the sum of numbers from `1` to `N`

**Concepts:** accumulator pattern, loop logic

---

### 7️⃣ Print Even Numbers

* Prints all even numbers between `1` and `N`

**Concepts:** modulus operator, conditions inside loops

---

### 8️⃣ Count Even Numbers

* Counts how many even numbers exist between `1` and `N`

**Concepts:** counter pattern, condition-based counting

---

### 9️⃣ Factorial of a Number

* Calculates factorial of a given number using a loop

**Concepts:** multiplication accumulator, mathematical logic

---

## 🧠 Learning Focus

The goal of this repository is not just to make programs work, but to:

* Understand **why** the logic works
* Practice writing **clean and readable code**
* Build habits required for **DSA and real-world problem solving**

Each program is written with simplicity and clarity in mind.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **Language:** Java
* **IDE:** Eclipse
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

* Digit-based problems (count digits, reverse number)
* Prime number logic
* Arrays and array traversal
* Introduction to basic DSA problems
